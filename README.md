# DATEX Specification

## Introduction

This is the official specification for the DATEX Protocol Language.
You can find this document on [github.com](https://github.com/unyt-org/datex-specification) and [datex.unyt.org](https://datex.unyt.org/).

DATEX is a modern communication protocol and language optimized for encrypted realtime data exchange and synchronization between multiple endpoints.

The DATEX specification is an open standard focused on web-based technology, but with support for other systems like IoT or mobile devices in mind.

The specification includes the *Datex Binary Format* (**DXB**) and the *DATEX Script Language* (**DATEX Script** or **DX**), which gets compiled to DXB and serves as a human-readable version of the DATEX Binary Format. The DATEX Script Language is a superset of the JSON format.

The DATEX protocol is a flexible multi-layer protocol that provides at least the functionality of an Application layer, but can also provide a Session, Transport, and Network layer  if needed, depending on the type of the actual underlying channel used for communication.

DATEX includes a cross-network pointer system and a extendable type system which is designed to support object-oriented approaches and helps with synchronization of object states between multiple clients. 
In addition, DATEX supports common primitive types (e.g. different sized integers), as well as binary streams.

## Applications of DATEX

The primary purpose of DATEX as a protocol is real-time communication between two or more parties via a direct channel or over the **DATEX Cloud**.<br>

Furthermore, DATEX can be used to store structured signed and/or encrypted data and scripts. 

DATEX can also be used to write reactive full-stack applications. DATEX can be extended with interfaces for specific use cases.
