# DATEX Specification

## Introduction

This is the official specification for the DATEX Protocol Language.
You can find this document on [github.com](https://github.com/unyt-org/datex-specification) and [docs.unyt.org](https://docs.unyt.org/datex).

DATEX is a communication protocol and language that provides realtime data exchange and synchronization for distributed applications.

The DATEX specification is an open standard focused on web-based technology with support for other systems like IoT and mobile devices.

DATEX is a flexible protocol that combines the Application, Session, Transport, and Network layer of the OSI Model.
The protocol offers encryption, signatures and authentication functionality.

DATEX introduces the concept of endpoints that form a peer-to-peer network, replacing the common server-client architecture.

DATEX incorporates a global shared memory that enables data synchronization between network participants (endpoints).
In addition, DATEX includes a general-purpose type system which is designed to interface with common programming languages.

This specification describes
 * the *DATEX Binary Format* (**DXB**) - the machine-readable bytecode format for DATEX
 * the *DATEX Script Language* (**DATEX Script** or **DX**) - human-readable representation of DATEX that gets compiled to DXB

<!--TODO: change/remove?-->
<!--The DATEX Script Language is a superset of the JSON format.-->


## Applications of DATEX

1. DATEX can be used as a protocol for communication between two or more parties
2. DATEX can be used to store structured signed and/or encrypted data for platform-independent usage
3. DATEX can be used to write scripts that can be executed locally or on remote endpoints
4. DATEX can be used as an interface to develop reactive full-stack applications (UIX)
5. DATEX enables permission handling for resources on a network level

All these applications serve as the backbone for the [unyt.org supranet](./020_terms.md#supranet).
