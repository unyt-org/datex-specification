# 0 Paradigms
> **Every design aspect of DATEX should respect the following design paradigms and constraints:**

1. Full JSON compatibility
2. Support standard primitive types + default types of JS
    - boolean
    - number
    - string
    - bigint
    - Date
    - URL
3. Stay as compact as possible and maximise the usefullness of a feature, don't implement features for a narrow use case
